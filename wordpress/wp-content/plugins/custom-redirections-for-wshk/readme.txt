After buy the addon, you will get a license code and the plugin installation files. Go to your backend, make click in Plugins > Add New and upload the .zip folder, after the installation, Active the plugin and go to "WooCommerce >> WSHK >> License" and paste your license code for activate it.

In the **SETTINGS** section: You can enable the Functions & Shortcodes, and here you will find the PREMIUM settings! With just a click in each  box, you can customize it, to get great results. 



= What can do each function ? =

DISPLAY TOTAL SPENT BY CURRENT USER WITH A CHART

This function just need be enabled, expand the advanced options for copy the shortcode & paste in your custom page, you can add your custom chart title, custom Y-axis title, custom X-axis title, custom currency and configure the chart options like the currency position, chart type, display or hide the chart title, the Y-axis and X-axis titles or the colors in the tooltips

CUSTOM REDIRECTIONS

This function is special if you are building your custom account page and need to keep the user in the same container after make click in any action button (VIEW ORDER, EDIT ADDRESSESS OR ADD PAYMENT METHOD).

You only need copy the ID from these containers and paste in each dedicated input, after it just save the changes and test the magic!

This function will be very important if you are building your custom account page and can be combined with the CUSTOM REDIRECTIONS function for get great results!

If you are building your account page with a builder or just with HTML/CSS code you will get the same results, just need add the ID's for logged in users and the ID's for the non logged in users in each row ID that you want restrict.

= How i can use the translation ready files? =

Custom Redirections for WSHK is internazionalized, have a English template and the ready Spanish translation.

By default the plugin take your site language how reference, so dont need nothing to get the plugin if your language is English or Spanish.

But now the plugin have a new tool for translate with just a click, if your Spanish translation is not correct, just go to WooCommerce > WSHK > languages and make click in the COPY/UPDATE button. The translations files will be copied automaticlly in your system.

If you need translate to other languages, you can do it by yourself, just need use [Loco Translate](https://es.wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/) or similars to write your own language with a English template.



= Which is your recommendation ? =

I recommend use it only if you are building your custom myaccount page, maybe can have other applications but was made to do a simple thing.

You can get more information in [WSHK PRO](https://disespubli.com/producto/custom-blocks-and-redirections-addon-for-wshk/).
